			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<img src="http://i.imgur.com/wJUxIbL.jpg" width="30%">
			<p>My name is Eric Sun. I am a recent graduate of Boston University, graduating with Magnum Cum Laude Latin Honors. I was born in the southeastern region of Connecticut, and moved Bristol County in Massachusetts during High School. I am an Eagle Scout, with my Boy Scout career starting in the 6th grade. During high school is when I discovered my passion for engineering, through a program called Project Lead the Way. Ever since, I've been tinkering and working towards my goal of being a successful engineer.</p>
			<p>Other than tinkering, my other hobbies include playing tennis, backpacking, and playing ukulele. My tennis career started young, around the age of 7. I held the position of first singles for all four years of high school. I taught tennis for Mansfield Parks and Recreation department, and still teach from time to time.</p>
			<p>During my time at Boston University, I worked as a Production Advisor for the Engineering Product Innovation center. Here I advised students on how to approach their projects with regard to design and manufacturing. I also took part in various research opportunities, including research at the Robotics Laboratory and the ANDESITE Satellite team.</p>
			<p>Most recently, I worked as a Production Engineer for PV Pure. My job was to oversee the mechanical design of the PV Pure water purification system, as well as consider the manufacturing of said system during the design stage.</p>
