			<p>WETA stands for Weather Email Temperature and Appointment. This raspberry pi based system was build to hang on my wall as a functional decoration. The code is Python Based, accessing the google API for email and calendar purposes. It would tell me the precipiation chance percentage, whether or not there was an email waiting for me, the temperature outside, and whether or not I had an upcoming calendar event. All of the notifications were mapped to RGB lights to show events and notifications based on certain colors.</p>
