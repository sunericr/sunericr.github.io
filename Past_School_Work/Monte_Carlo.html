      <p>A great deal of data was generated by conducting a Monte Carlo Analysis on a tumbling satellite simulation. Using MATLBA, this data was compiled by me onto one graph, highlighing various chance percentages that the space battery was going to fail. The purpose was to see what were the chances that our chosen battery would fail in space, based on various tumbling situations. </p>
